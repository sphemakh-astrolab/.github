# Programming Essentials for Astronomy I: C++ and Python

These computer labs aim to teach essential programming concepts and tools for modern astrophysics. In the first semseter, we will learn the basics of progarmming using the [C++ programming language](https://isocpp.org/tour). Then, in the second semester these will be reinforced as we move on to the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org), which will be used to teach the fundamentals of scientific data analysis. The Labs are facilitated using the GitHub platform, and an account on the platform is required for participation.  **Note: GitHub allows multiple e-mail addresses, so if you prefer to open your account using a personal e-mail address, please add your university e-mail after creating the account -- instructions on how to do this can be found on this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/how-tos/email-preferences/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account)**

## System Setup

The primary computer interface for these labs is the Linux Terminal. However, most of the machines in our computer Lab have the Windows opertaning system installed instead of Linux. However, The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) allows running Linux environment, including command-line tools and applications, directly on Windows. In our case, the falvour of Linux will be [Ubuntu]([url](https://ubuntu.com/)). 
* **Install Ubuntu via WSL**
* Launch the Windows Command Prompt Terminal (type "command prompt" in your windows search bar)
* Run `wsl --install` # This will take a few minutes
* Then launch Ubuntu by running `wsl -d Ubuntu`
* On the first launch, you be prompted to set a username and password (set these as you wish.)
